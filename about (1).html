    <h1>The Story Behind Carmen’s Canvas</h1>

    <p>Carmen didn’t just choose to be an artist. She chose to <em>remember</em>.</p>

    <p>Her journey began in the deserts of Arizona, where the sun felt ancient and the cacti stood like quiet gods. As a child, she knew there was more to life than what the world taught. She could feel energy move through her body. She saw beauty in the small things—hands, color, emotion—and she knew she was here to <em>create meaning</em>.</p>

    <p>But like so many, Carmen had to forget in order to return.</p>

    <p>Through personal healing, spiritual awakening, and deep inner work, Carmen began to remember who she really is:
    An alchemist of color.
    A lightworker in disguise.
    A portal back to the sacred through art.</p>

    <p>Carmen’s Canvas is where her soul speaks. Her paintings are not just visuals—they are <strong>vessels</strong>. Each piece is infused with emotion, memory, and light codes for those ready to remember.</p>

    <p>You’re not just buying a painting. You’re reconnecting with beauty, truth, and something ancient inside you.</p>

    <div class="affirmation">
        “I create from the sacred fire within me.<br>
        Each piece I make awakens something divine.<br>
        I don’t need permission—I am here to remember and remind.”
